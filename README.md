Analysis for Visualizations of weather on earth based on latitudes

Project Overview:

The project was undertaken to compare the change of weather across various cities of the world taking data of more than 500 cities around the globe.

Resources/cities.csv


Objective: To analyze how the following weather conditions get affected by the change of latitude of earth 
1.	Cloudiness
2.	Wind Speed
3.	Humidity
4.	Temperature


Project Outline / Task: 

1.	The data need to be downloaded and cleaned up. 
2.	Build the charts for each of the factors. Give all charts headings and titles.
3.	Build Individual pages for each of the factors. 
4.	Build a comparisons page. 
5.	Build a data page for showcasing the data. 
6.	Build search links to take the user to various data links.  
7.	Use HTML, Bootstrap, Nav bar and CSS for visualization. 

Summarization
1.	No evident relationship is observed between latitude and cloudiness.
2.	The windspeed is higher as you move away from equator.
3.	There is no correlation between average humidity and latitude.
4.	The temperature rises as we go nearer the equator.
